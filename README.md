# Portfolio-Website

This website will likely be changed and upgraded over time. As it is meant to be a portfolio I will eventually add a spot to showcase future web and software projects.

I used some code and was heavily inspired by Shaif Arfan's project. Used with permission under the MIT license. You can find his project here: https://github.com/WebCifar/one-page-website-html-css-project-for-practice
